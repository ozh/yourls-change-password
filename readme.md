# Plugin for YOURLS : Change Password [![Listed in Awesome YOURLS!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Awesome-YOURLS-C5A3BE)](https://github.com/YOURLS/awesome-yourls/)

> This plugin requires YOURLS 1.7+ 

## What for

This plugin allows updating your password from the web instead of having to edit a config file.

This makes YOURLS integrate more easily with your password manager if you are using one.

If you are not using one, do consider doing it. Don't bother remember secure passwords, let tools do it for you.

## How to

* In `/user/plugins`, create a new folder named `change-password`
* Drop these files in that directory
* Go to the Plugins administration page and activate the plugin 
* Update your password for a more secure one ;)

## FAQ

1. "it didn't work!"
* Sorry, it does for me. No sweat, just edit your config file as usual and reset your password. See wiki for how to [edit username and passwords](http://yourls.org/userpassword).

## License

Do whatever the hell you want with it.
